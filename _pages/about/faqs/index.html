<div class="board"><div class="boardtitle">Q. What is the KodingWindow?</div>
    <p>KodingWindow is an open-source programming platform for learners to realize their potential and build mind-blowing practical solutions. This platform has hundreds of problem statements, solutions, and approaches in various programming languages to boost the confidence of students, novices, job seekers, IT professionals, etc.</p>
</div>

<div class="board"><div class="boardtitle">Q. Why it is an open-source platform?</div>
    <p><a href="shubhamrdarda" class="hlink">{{ site.founder }}</a>, the Founder and Architect of KodingWindow, is inspired by the great <a href="{{ site.data.url.kwiddankd }}" target="_blank" class="hlink">Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam</a>. He doesn't want learners to be in any constraint or boundary. Furthermore, the KodingWindow would like to spark your ideas, energize your brain, encourage you to think uniquely, and help you to identify your unfathomable potential.</p>
</div>

<div class="board"><div class="boardtitle">Q. Who can learn on this platform?</div>
    <p>Anyone. Whoever has an alacrity to learn programming concepts, algorithms, and different approaches to solve the problems are welcome. It is an additional benefit for learners who are having a (Diploma, Engineering, Technology, etc.) background in Computer Science and Information Technology.</p>
</div>

<div class="board"><div class="boardtitle">Q. Why should I contribute to this platform?</div>
    <p>KodingWindow is continuously improving the standard in terms of coding approaches, cogent explanations, algorithms, etc. This platform will help thousands of learners which might turn out to be a career-changing moment, and we never know when and how our approaches and solutions can help others.</p>
</div>

<div class="board"><div class="boardtitle">Q. How to contribute on this platform?</div>
    <p>You can share your problem statement along with algorithm, solution, and output with an explanation in a single text file. It doesn't matter either you write two or thousand lines of code. What matters is the different approaches to solve a problem, the logic behind the code, and how efficient it is (only in terms of time-complexity). However, please refer to the next question which talks about criteria to contribute.</p>
</div>

<div class="board"><div class="boardtitle">Q. What are the criteria to contribute?</div>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>1.</b> You need to submit at least <b>fifty</b> problem statements along with solutions, outputs, and explanation for each. Create a file of your work and submit it to us on <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}" class="hlink">{{ site.email }}</a>.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>2.</b> The programs and explanations must be originally written by you, and it mustn't be published anywhere.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>3.</b> The problem statements and solutions which already exist on the KodingWindow aren't going to re-publish again. Therefore, before submitting your work, you need to take a quick look at available problem statements and solutions so that you can utilize your time accordingly.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> We follow our internal guidelines to evaluate your work. Approximately, it takes fifteen days to examine and evaluate the same. Nevertheless, it might take more time depending upon the quality and type of work submitted.</p>
